# Boolean expressions is an expression that is either true or false
# Relational operators are !=  >  <  >=  <=  ==
# Logical operator is one of the operations that combinds boolean expressions: and or not
# Conditional statement is a statment that controls the flow of execution depending on some condition
# Compound statement is a statement that consists of a header and a ody. The header ends with a colon (:), and the body is indented relative to the header
# Branch is one fo the alternative sequences of statements in a conditional statment
# Conditional statements gives you ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly
# Boolean expression after if is called condition
# if x > 0: is a condition
# Statement followed by indented body after if is called compound statements
#   print "x is positive" is compound statement
# Conditional execution  is a statement where there is a choice of something or nothing
# Alternative execution is a choice of something or something else
# Chained conditionals is a choice of something or something else or something else .....
# Base case is a conditional branch in a recursive function that does not make a recursive call
# Base case does not call itself
# Recursive case calls itself
# The process of recursive calling itsefl is called recursion
# Argument- you can get information into a function using argument
# The symbol "=" is called assignment operator. It is used to assign the value on its right to its left. That means it assigns the value on the right to the left.
# A function is a named sequence of statement that perform a special task, or a computation. Defining a function means to specify name and sequence of statements. When you have a function, you can use its name to call a function.
# The keyword "return" takes in argument from a function and return, or spit out, a result. The result is called return value.
# Five basic data types: boolean, integer, float, string, tuple 
# boolean: True, False
# integer: 0, 12, -34, 2314
# float: 0.0, 23.45, -4.3
# string: "Hello", "what,  is this"
# tuple: ("Diana", "Oh", 3423)
# A function definition is defining, or giving a function value. It specifies name of a new function and the sequence of statements that execute when the function is called. Function call is when you spit out the function by using the function's name. You first used function definition to define a function, then you use function call to call a function.
#Three phrases every computer program has: Input- program take in input from the user, processing- program use the input to perform a calculatio and spit out the output, output- program returns the result of calculation
# Indentation tells where function definition ends and it tells when to call a function and return a value
# Order of operations: parentheses - exponents - multiplication and division - addition and subtraction - comparisons - not - and - or - if...else
# Function call is when you spit out a function by using its name
# Function is a name for sequence of statment that performs a task, or computation
